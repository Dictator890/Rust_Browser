# Rust_Browser
This is just a simple effort to create an browser using Rust language which has a GUI and can parse HTML and CSS files easily. 

# Development is still in progress 😄😄😄

This project aims to demonstrate how a web browser parses HTML files to create a DOM and applies CSS to it.It is not as fast as the browsers used for everyday work but it is just a test sample.The code is easily readable so anyone who understands rust can easily read this code and also develop it by himself/herself.

I will soon update the readme accordingly as the updates happen

## Files
1 DOM.RS-This files hold the elements which are useful generation of DOM .It provides various non primitive datatypes as well as methods used for handling of the DOM

2.HTMLParser.RS-This file is the html parse engine that will be used by the browser to create DOM.It can parse most the elements such as text,Comments and Data Elements.

### Update 28/03/2021
Added CSS Parser to easily parse the CSS files.The datastructures for the same have also been added.Currently suppourted types for colors are only rgba and name base colors.Eg 'blue' ,'green',etc.Suppourt for rgb function coming soon.

Font types are not suppourted by the CSS Parser currently but is to be released in future versions.

## Will update as soon as possible for fresh changes 👍
